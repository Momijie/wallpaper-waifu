# WALLPAPER-WAIFU
<img src="./docs/example.png">

# Introduction
<p>
    Wallpaper-waifu aims to generate a minimalist wallpaper with a waifu on it when
    given specific parameters. 
    The above being the default example with the config being baked in and images used held in .default. 
</p>
<p>
    The secondary goal of wallpaper-waifu is to easily be able to regenerate a similiar wallpaper when you change the system theme/colors.
